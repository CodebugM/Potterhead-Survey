# Potterhead-Survey
Free Code Camp Responsive Web Design Project

This is a project I completed as part of freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification. This project is mainly designed to help students learn more about HTML and CSS, so there is no JS involved, you can't actually submit the survey or anyhting but if you want to contact me about it or have suggestions about the code, feel free to contact me here :)

Things I learned during this challenge
	• I did this challenge in Atom because I realised I like working there a lot better than in CodePen because I can arrange the code and the window with the output in it in a way that I find easier to work with.
	• During the course of this challenge I read up (a lot) on design like combining different font types etc. And I have found that SUPER helpful. In fact, it has inspired me to go back to my Tribute page and a) redo that one in Atom as well, and b) apply some of the design tips I have read up upon to that as well.
	• I would get by easily and could just submit the challenges when they function (that works without CSS for the most part - or at least for the first two I have completed so far) but I want to build the habit of always giving each website my all and applying the rules of design and making website both informational/functional AND beautiful/visually appealing because I want to contribute to building a better world wide web that way. (Plus, if I am being honest, any website that is actually online I will hold to certain standards and I should at least meet those expectations - despite my website not being published).
	• Code-wise I learned that in order to apply the different styles (if that is the correct word) of Google Fonts, in CSS you specify the font-weight attribute like so: font-weight: 700;
  And I learned that in order to make your background image fill the entire screen instead of being repeated either vertically or horizontally, you need to specify the background-size attribute like so: background-size: cover;
  
  One of the websites I found very useful when it comes to combining fonts is https://inkbotdesign.com/font-combinations/. It includes a great list of "10 beautiful font combinations for all your design needs".
  
  I think I did an okay job with the fonts of my project - you have to have a somewhat Harry Potter-y font, as a title, don't you - and the combination of the shades of green and yellow respectively work together quite well, I think; the yellow particularly because it is supposed to be somewhat close to the yellow light emanating from the castle windows. I had to, however, choose a slightly darker shade of yellow, so the text would still be readable against the cloudy sky. It still remains somewhat less legible than I would have liked and this is one of the criticisms I have of my own work: The background image is not the best because it has a lot of variation of both light and dark colours on it that makes choosing a text colour that is legible no matter where it appears against the background very hard to do. I am torn between just picked a picture of a sky (maybe above the quidditch pitch) but you just have to have a picture of Hogwarts as the background, don't you? So I am leaving it as it is for now :)
